      " - I can see that your account is active; and most likely you have locked out your device from allowing you to log in because you've entered an incorrect username continuously for a number of attempts.   Please note that your Username is case-sensitive; so please be sure to pay attention to how you enter each character of your Username. We would advise you to enter it manually and not copy-paste it. If it appears that you forgot your username; you can retrieve it in 15 minutes; after following this LINK and completing the steps. Alternatively; you can give us a call at 800-982-7850 and our dedicated specialist can assist you further.   As for the lockout message; if it is still in place for you; you should simply wait 15 minutes after your last attempt and try to repeat the process.     You can also do this with a different browser or via an incognito mode in your current browser after those 15 minutes (To open an incognito mode window please press CTRL+SHIFT+N keyboard keys simultaneously); in case there is still an issue with your access to the account on that device/browser you are using.  If you were using a Mobile app - please reinstall it in 15 minutes in case the lockout is not resolved after that. This will allow you to try entering your Username again.\n",

One; I wouldn’t have known about this if they had not sent me an email. Why can no one tell me why this payment was returned??

      " - For mortgages; principal-only payments must be made on the same day as your regular monthly payment to prevent additional interest from being deducted. You can either include the extra amount in a larger single payment or make a second separate payment on the same day. This ensures the extra funds go directly toward the principal.\n",
      " - If you're making the payment from an external bank; GLCU does not allow principal-only payments that way. To apply extra funds to principal from an external source; you first need to transfer the funds into your GLCU Share Savings account; then call <PERSON> to request that the funds be manually applied to the principal.\n",

In a hypothetical scenario where on all days the balance was around; say; $750 and on one single day it dipped to; say; $300; the average daily balance would still be higher than $500. Say your daily balance on April 1st; 2nd and 3rd was $300 every day. You would need three days with the balance of $700; so that six days average out to $500.\n",

      " - That’s okay! I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t an issue! I appreciate your assistance\n",
      " - Do you know when I will be able to see / use the initial $1200 deposit I added to my account\n",
      " - Here’s a general idea of how long it may take for your deposit to fully process; depending on the type of check:  For most checks; the first $225 is available right away.  The next $5;300 is usually available within 1–2 business days; depending on the type.\n",
      " - If the check is over $5;525; the remaining amount is released by the 6th or 7th business day.  Also; all checks for the first 30 days the account is open are automatically placed on a 10-business day hold. Here’s a quick breakdown depending on what type of check is deposited:\n",
      " - Personal checks: Typically clear in 2 business days; with any extra funds (over $5;525) available by the 7th business day.  Payroll checks (GLCU members only); government checks; and cashier’s checks/postal money orders: Usually available faster — within 1 business day; and the rest by the 6th business day if over the $5;525 threshold.\n",
      " - Mortgage payment checks: no hold is applied  Other types of checks: Generally follow the same timing as personal checks.  Keep in mind; these timeframes are standard; but when making a deposit you would usually receive a receipt; on which you can see the specified date of processing and funds availability.\n",
      " - If you don't have the receipt; the date would still be available in your Digital banking near the deposit transaction record in History tab.  To see whether the check can be processed faster; we would advise you to call our main office at (800) 982-7850 or (847)-578-7000 and our specialists from the Deposit operations will help you to manually overview each check and confirm how long it could take and if they can make the process faster.\n",
      " - Good morning;Im trying to enroll in online banking after opening and adolescent account but it tried to enroll and after many attempts it has locked me out from my device do you think you can enroll me from my device?\n",

      " - Hello. Why am I getting charged an insane amount of interest all of a sudden ?\n",
      " - Good morning <PERSON>. Can you please tell me why I’m getting charged so much ? Thank you\n",
      " - Could you please confirm if the loan in question is 81 2016 BMW 7 SERIES?\n",
      " - The CPI addon is added to the loan; because we have not received proof of your auto insurance; that reflects GLCU as the lienholder for your vehicle.\n",
      " - This is a requirement of the loan; and letters were previously mailed before the CPI was added.\n",
      " - To see if the CPI can be removed from the loan; please contact your insurance company and have the following information added to the policy as the lienholder for the vehicle:  Great Lakes Credit Union PO Box 2238 <LOCATION>; <LOCATION> <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>\n",
      " - The updated Declaration Page can then be faxed to 800-709-4817 or sent via the secure messages section.\n",
      " - Please note that all of the $80 charges can be refunded after you provide the documentation as a proof of coverage.\n",
      " - I don’t drive the car as it needs major repairs on transmission. No insurance is needed since it sits. This allows you guys to charge 80 plus raise interest payments ?\n",
      " - My interest skyrocketed from 45$ to 350$\n",
      " - I understand. Regarding the specifics of the interest rate it is best to contact our loan specialists at (800) 982-7850 or (847) 578-7000 during working hours.\n",
      " - I want to pay off my loan but I want to make sure I’m using correct account number etc\n",
      " - And that is the number 1 and then 083 right I have it on my app but wanted to verify what address or is there a routing number for GLCU fir electronic payment I see roguing number in my app acct but wanted to verify\n",
      " - Great Lakes Credit Union's 9-digit routing number is: <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>.  Your member number is <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>. At the end of your account number you will add an 83 for the Lifestyle Loan. This makes it a complete 10 digit Lifestyle Loan account number.  To pay off your loan; you can use our eZPay portal; available in the App menu under Payments and Transfers - eZPay. This requires a separate login from your online banking account used to access loan information.\n",
      " - It is being paid electronically by another party so I would give my account number of <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER> and then the routing number of <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER> correct\n",
      " - If they require address <PERSON> what is it\n",
      " - Our standard mailing address \tGreat Lakes Credit Union; <PERSON> 1289 Bannockburn; IL <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER> Overnight address is our <LOCATION> office \t2525 Green Bay Rd North Chicago; IL <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>\n",
      " - You're very welcome. Please let us know if we can help you with any other information today <PERSON>\n",

      " - Since you are not enrolled yet; I will not be able to have access to your account. Live chat agents are only limited to access enrolled members only at this time.\n",
      " - But we can still try; please take a moment to fill in the form for me to try to locate your account.\n",
      " - These type of lockouts might happen due to too many failed attempts.\n",
      " - However the lockout should be lifted in 15 minutes from the last login attempt.\n",
      " - I see that <PERSON> took over $9000.00 for my mortgage BUT I don’t see my mortgage account reduced by that amount.  Where did that money go?  Why can’t I see an account ending in 5132?\n",
      " - Sure.  I appreciate your time.\n",

      " - Whew!  I’ll follow up later today .\n",
      " - I can confirm that the transaction was completed correctly and your balance will be updated.\n",
      " - Thank you; <PERSON>.  I’m heading out to a funeral this morning and didn’t want anything else on my mind to worry about .\n",

      " - Welcome back.\n",
      " - Ok..couldn’t find the info on the direct website.\n",
      " - Could you please provide more information about the case?\n",
      " - someone charged on my debit without authorization\n",
      " - I have located your account. Could you please tell which transaction is unauthorized?\n",
      " - murphy walmart for 100.00\n",
      " - I am sorry that such thing happened to your account.\n",
      " - Unfortunately pending transactions cannot be stopped. They can be disputed after they clear.\n",
      " - You can do that by navigating to Settings &gt; Opt In and Time zone.\n",
      " - At this time. I will escalate this case as a high priority to our dedicated team to review your account.\n",

      " - <NUMERIC_IDENTIFIER>-80\n",
      " - I understand you want to pay for your car loan?\n",
      " - I was not able to locate your account; it most probably you are not yet enrolled in the online banking.\n",
      " - Could you please confirm if you would like to pay for your loan with an external account?\n",
      " - You can make your payment via eZPay.  Please follow the link and you would be asked for your account number; last 4 digits of your SSN and date of birth.\n",
      " - I tried it's not letting me go through\n",
      " - I understand. You are required to enter your GLCU member/account number to locate your loan via eZPay.\n",
      " - If you don't know your <PERSON> account number; the only option to learn it would be to contact us at (800) 982-7850 or (847) 578-7000 or visit a branch.\n",
      " - Please note that for a car loans GLCU offers a 10-day grace period for which you will not be penalized.\n",
      " - Failed to deposit my money\n",
      " - I understand that you failed to deposit a check through a Mobile deposit in your <PERSON> application; correct?\n",
      " - I went to the atm to deposit money and it wouldn’t let me\n",
      " - If the ATM wouldn’t let you deposit money; here are some possible reasons:\n",
      " - The ATM might not be a deposit-taking machine. While all GLCU branch ATMs have deposit capability; not all CO-OP network ATMs do. – If you used a non-GLCU ATM; it may have daily or per-transaction deposit limits; or simply may not accept deposits at all. – There could be a temporary issue with your card; such as a block; or the card might not be properly linked to the account. – If the deposit was a check; it’s also possible the check image wasn’t read correctly; or the machine flagged an issue with the format or endorsement.\n",
      " - To verify whether an ATM accepts deposits; you can use the CO-OP ATM locator and select the “Take Deposit” filter here: https://co-opcreditunions.org/locator/\n",
      " - If the issue persists; I recommend calling <PERSON> at (800) 982-7850 so a representative can check your account and card status. Let me know if you’d like help finding the nearest working ATM or preparing for the call.\n",
      " - I have an $8 check that I want to make sure gets paid\n",
      " - I I got a fee but it doesn’t show paid\n",
      " - Could you please provide more information about the check and fee?\n",
      " - And the date the check was deposited?\n",
      " - $30 fee for an $8 check I wrote\n",
      " - I guess because I had an ach pending when the check came out it went negative but I deposited part of my paycheck today to cover any shortage.. I just don’t want that $8 check to bounce it’s for my kids school\n",
      " - Indeed; our records do not show an $8 check withdrawal.\n",
      " - This would require an attention of our specialists.\n",
      " - I can create a follow-up for our dedicated team.\n",
      " - Could you please confirm the where the check was written for? (name of organization and the date).\n",
      " - I would need this information to include in the follow-up.\n",
      " - School district 158\n",
      " - I don’t remember the exact date\n",
      " - I have created a follow-up. Once reviewed our specialists will update you via an email or secure messages in your digital banking.\n",
      " - When do you think they’ll get back to me because I know when checks bounce you have a very short window to approve it\n",
      " - The requests sent by our team are typically reviewed withing 1-3 working days.\n",
      " - Yikes I might miss the window is there a way to expedite\n",
      " - We use to have forms that we could submit when a check was going to bounce\n",
      " - I will flag this case as a high priority to make sure that our specialists will review it in the first place. Still it might take 1 business day.\n",
      " - Also note that follow-ups are reviewed during working hours only.\n",
      " - GLCU no longer uses a specific form for pre-bounce check notifications; but they do provide tools to help prevent checks from bouncing.\n",
      " - Instead of a form; <PERSON> recommends that members: – Sign up for free eAlerts; which can notify you when your balance is low or when a transaction posts. – Monitor your account activity through Digital Banking. – Set up overdraft protection (like SafetyNet or linked accounts) if eligible; to help cover checks when funds are short.\n",
      " - Unable to deposit check due to the amount having ** after the dollar amount. It’s saying it’s detecting a different amount than what was entered.\n",
      " - I already wrote for mobile deposit only on the back of each check\n",
      " - How can this be fixed\n",
      " - If you're unable to deposit a check through GLCU's mobile app because the amount includes asterisks (e.g.; $1;234.56) and it says the system is detecting a different amount; here’s what’s likely happening:  – The app’s mobile check deposit scanner is having trouble reading the amount due to the formatting (e.g.; asterisks or unusual spacing). – This causes a mismatch between the amount you manually entered and what the app reads from the image.\n",
      " - To resolve this:  – Try retaking the photo of the check; ensuring it's well-lit; flat; and fully in frame. – If it still fails; the best option is to visit a GLCU branch or a deposit-enabled CO-OP ATM to complete the deposit in person.\n",
      " - Let me know if you’d like help locating a nearby ATM or branch.\n",
      " - Can I still deposit the check even if it says for mobile deposit on the back\n",
      " - In person\n",
      " - Yes; you can still deposit the check at a GLCU branch or ATM even if it says 'For Mobile Deposit Only' on the back.\n",
      " - However in CO-OP branches it depends on how strictly the check issuer or the institution receiving the deposit enforces endorsement restrictions.\n",
      " - Can I use any atm without fees\n",
      " - You can use many ATMs without fees; but not all. As a GLCU member; here’s how to avoid ATM fees:  – You can use GLCU ATMs and any ATMs in the CO-OP Network without surcharge fees – The CO-OP Network includes over 30;000 ATMs nationwide – You can find a no-fee ATM using GLCU’s ATM locator: https://co-opcreditunions.org/locator/  If you use an out-of-network ATM; GLCU may charge a fee; and the ATM owner might add a surcharge too.  Let me know if you’d like help locating the nearest free ATM.\n",

      " - Could you please clarify at which step you are facing issues?\n",
      " - Yea when I put my card info into my cashapp it said “your bank declined your request”\n",
      " - It was already linked before so i tried sending money to my greats lake account from my cashapp account but it randomly declined it. And thats when i removed my card details and tried entering them again but it declined\n",

      " - This was charged by an online website subscription. Unfortunately; we are not able to stop the payment since the transaction was already completed out of <PERSON>. But we can issue a dispute against this transaction.\n",
      " - However; it might take up to 45 days to complete the dispute process for this charge. So; we highly recommend contacting the merchant to cancel the subscription or refund the funds.\n",
      " - Sure I just don’t want they keep charging my card\n",
      " - Which would be the fastest way to return your funds.\n",
      " - Is ok card\n",
      " - Can you cancel this card\n",
      " - You can disable your card on your app by going to the Card Controls and and toggling the button to disable.\n",
      " - How can I secure debit cards to avoid scammers?\n",
      " - I will be assisting you today.\n",
      " - Transfer Limitations and Monitoring:  Transfers of larger amounts are subject to manual review; ensuring an additional layer of oversight. Suspicious or unusual transactions are flagged and investigated to prevent unauthorized activity.\n",
      " - Thank you for your question and for your patience. Our institution takes security very seriously; especially when it comes to protecting your funds. Here is an overview of the measures in place to safeguard your account:\n",
      " - Enhanced Login Security:  We use One-Time Passwords (OTP) for account login; adding an extra step to verify your identity. Biometric authentication (such as fingerprint or facial recognition) can also be enabled through the application settings for added security.\n",
      " - Advanced Fraud Detection Systems:  Our systems are continuously monitored to detect and prevent hacking attempts or fraudulent transactions. Secure Banking Channels:  All online and mobile banking sessions are encrypted to protect your data from being intercepted by unauthorized parties.\n",
      " - These measures work together to ensure your account is protected against hackers and unauthorized access. We recommend enabling all available security features; such as biometrics; and regularly monitoring your account for any unusual activity.\n",
      " - While we do use the latest security systems for card transactions; we greatly advise you to be cautious when using your card — for example; you should not give your card information to someone else or save it in browsers. Please also make sure to use reputable ATMs.\n",
      " - Would you recommend using a credit card instead of a debit card as more secure?\n",
      " - Both credit and debit cards have their own security features; and the choice between them largely depends on personal preference and financial habits. It's important to use whichever card you choose responsibly and to take necessary precautions to safeguard your financial information.\n",
      " - My cards currently display a debit logo. Can I use these cards as credit cards?\n",
      " - Is there a way to use them as a credit card all the time and prevent them from being used as a debit card?\n",
      " - A debit card is by definition a debit card and cannot be 'transformed' into a credit one. It is connected to your Checking account and uses your own funds. A debit card can be run as credit by the merchant but this will not make a debit card credit.\n",
      " - For example; in <PERSON> there is a $1;500 limit for debit-based transactions and $5;000 — for credit-based transactions on your debit card. Running the card as credit has to be done by the merchant. Most online merchants conduct credit-based transactions as opposed to debit-based.\n",
      " - I see. Is there a way to lock the savings funds and allow the checking account to be functional while using only the debit card?\n",

      " - How much\n",
      " - You may request it by  sending us a secure message; or calling.\n",
      " - Rush Debit/ ATM / Credit Card Replacement   $20 &gt; three requests/year $0.00 &lt; three or less requests/year\n",

      " - It seems that it can be free of charge; if you haven't requested the rush delivery this year yet.\n",

Foreign passports are also accepted. You also need a valid Social Security Number or Individual Tax Identification Number. Applicants must be at least 18 years old to open the account online.

      " - I plan to go to a local branch office. What is the purpose of filling out a application? I am not use to an application when opening up a account\n",
      " - At GLCU; filling out an application—whether online or in a branch—is a standard part of the account opening process. It helps the credit union collect the necessary personal; financial; and identification details to:  - Confirm your identity under federal regulations like the USA PATRIOT Act - Determine your eligibility for membership - Set up your account properly in the system - Ensure compliance with banking laws and fraud prevention\n",
      " - Even in a branch; the application ensures everything is documented and verified before your account is officially opened. A team member will walk you through it and answer any questions while you're there; so the process should be smooth and straightforward.\n",
      " - Also note that checking account is available to members only. To be eligible for membership at Great Lakes Credit Union (GLCU); you must meet at least one of the following criteria:  – You live or work in certain areas including <LOCATION>; <PERSON>; <PERSON>; Will; <LOCATION>; or <LOCATION> in <LOCATION>; <LOCATION> in <LOCATION>; or in the vicinity of <LOCATION>; <LOCATION> – You are related to someone who lives or works in one of those qualifying areas – You are employed by one of <PERSON>’s affiliated organizations; such as BAC Administrative District Council 1 of Illinois; Ball Horticultural; <LOCATION> 228; IBEW Local 134 or 1220; <LOCATION> Local 504; Morton College; One Summer <LOCATION>; or Teamsters Local 705 – You are an active military member or federal government employee—or a relative of someone who is – You are a member of the Leaders Network – You are currently employed by <PERSON>\n",

      " - Hi <PERSON>. I just did “easy cash” and would like to use the money in my personal checking account. How do I transfer\n",
      " - If you were approved the funds typically deposited to your savings account.\n",
      " - The funds are in my share savings account but I would like to transfer that to my personal checking with BMO\n",
      " - To do that you have got multiple options.\n",
      " - Fastest was is to use Zelle.\n",
      " - I can Zelle from the share savings to myself with my personal checking?\n",
      " - You can also transfer fund to your BMO account via BillPay or by linking your BMO account to GLCU online banking.\n",
      " - Which is easier / quicker\n",
      " - No; in order to use Zelle you would have to transfer your funds from savings to your checking (it is done in 3-4 click immediately).\n",
      " - Can you walk me thru that?\n",
      " - The quickest way would be using Zelle.\n",
      " - Yes I used my phone number\n",
      " - If the phone number/email address is already linked to another Zelle account the system will not proceed.\n",
      " - It’s just my normal Zelle account\n",
      " - To use Zelle within GLCU you need to enroll in Zelle in GLCU online banking.\n",
      " - Sure; let me know if you face any issues.\n",
      " - It is in the Menu; it might also be 'Payments and Transfers'.\n",
      " - Payments and Transfers is not clickable; this is just a section in the Menu. In that section you should see Zelle.\n",
      " - Still not working\n",
      " - You can also transfer your fund by linking your external account to GLCU digital banking.\n",
      " - I will try that\n",
      " - Please note that you would need to access your account via a browser; not the mobile application.\n",
      " - I need the funds today so whatever I can do for that\n",
      " - Could you please tell on which step it failed?\n",
      " - And what error message it is giving?\n",
      " - After I select the amount to Zelle and click send it says unable\n",
      " - Now it says it went thru but didn’t go to my checking it zelle’d back to <PERSON>\n",
      " - Thanks. Yeah it went back to my GLCU checking\n",
      " - I can see that you accidentally sent the funds to yourself.\n",
      " - If you accidentally selected your own email or number during the send process; Zelle may have routed it back to your linked GLCU account.\n",
      " - Yeah I meant to do myself because I need the money in my normal checking account and out of <PERSON>\n",
      " - Please make sure to select the email or phone number that is linked to your BMO account.\n",
      " - The email and phone number linked to my <PERSON> and BMO are the same\n",
      " - You would need to link to <PERSON> account a different phone number or email to make a successful transfer.\n",
      " - You can opt to set your phone number to your BMO and email to <PERSON>.\n",
      " - I’ll try opt out phone number with <PERSON>\n",
      " - Account settings?\n",
      " - Yes; navigate to setting within the Zelle.\n",
      " - Yeah I’m not sure. This is too complicated I just need the funds in my BMO checking asap\n",
      " - GLCU won’t allow me to remove my phone number because I need one on file\n",
      " - You can try to remove your email address and link your phone number to BMO account.\n",
      " - Won’t let me remove email either\n",
      " - Yes; that is correct. GLCU requires at least one phone number and one email address at all times.\n",
      " - If you have a separate email address you can add it a remover the old one.\n",
      " - If you don't have a different email address; then you can quickly create one and make sure that different contact information are set for your BMO and GLCU accounts.\n",
      " - Could you please tell the amount you are trying to withdraw?\n",
      " - 300 dollars out of savings\n",
      " - Also; where are your ATMs located at where i don’t have to pay a fee\n",
      " - You can use CO-OP ATMs without a fee. You can find one at this link: https://co-opcreditunions.org/locator/\n",
      " - GLCU ATMs can be found here: https://www.glcu.org/24-7-access/locations/  In the dropdown you would need to set the filter to GLCU ATMs only to find a GLCU ATM.\n",
      " - Regarding the withdrawal issue I would recommend you to contact our  Dedicated Visa department at 866-902-6628 to have them investigate this issue further - please choose the first option and do not enter any card number; this way you will be forwarded to a live agent to have the <PERSON> reviewed and to receive further assistance.

Processing Time: If everything matches; the money should usually arrive within a few minutes—but in some cases; it might take a bit longer; especially if it was your first time enrolling.  3. Confirmation: Check your email or text messages for any confirmation from Zelle. Sometimes; there’s a link you may need to click to complete the transfer.  If you've confirmed all this and still don’t see the funds; feel free to give us a call by one of the following numbers: (800) 982-7850 or (847)-578-7000\n",

      " - without fees\n",
      " - can you look at what happened?\n",
      " - Thank you. This credit card payment was not paid; you were charged an ACH Overdrawn Fee. These fees are assessed when preauthorized transactions are attempted and funds are not available. Overdrawn ACH fees are unavoidable when you have transactions processing by account and routing number.\n",
      " - Can you please confirm which exact account number was given to the credit card provider?\n",
      " - I put the wrong Savings in and used 01 vs 02\n",

      " - but you should have seen that and fixed or pulled it from the correct acct.  I am signed up for overdraft I clearly had the money to cover it.\n",

      " - Hello. Have a question. How much is fee for cashiers check if I walk into local branch bank &amp; request one?\n",
      " - Well; do you have an alternative item I may be able to use if I desire to render funds to a place of business locally. I'm wanting to pay off a bill t to a state supported entity  be able to present a receipt plus cashiers check to receipt to State of Illinois. What's the best course or action to take in this cirumstance?\n",
      " - You may order an Official Check; it will be free of charge.\n",
      " - So just walk into the bank &amp; ask for an 'Official Check?' Will it be immediately available for them to cash?  B/C I'm hoping they will take 'Official Checks.' instead of a Cashiers Check. I guess I want to pay in the way that I want to make it official and quick so they have no question the funds are there for them to take &amp; I'll be done with it for good..if you will.\n",
      " - Okay. Thx.\n",
      " - Banks must make the first $5;525 available within one business day. However; additional funds or amounts the bank suspects may be fraudulent may be held longer.\n",
      " - Also; if that's the government entities you are dealing with;\n",
      " - You may be able to make a payment online; please try researching this option on the internet.\n",
      " - It is often the case that government entities offer online payments; and in case if you have a GLCU account; you may be able to make a payment this way.\n",
      " - Okay; Well; what I have done just for precaution is I just set up a external transfer option from another credit union I belong to <PERSON> so I'm able to possibly pull my funds if needed to go somewhere else to create a cashiers check for the transferred funds. Its going to be about $800ish. Will I be able to fully pull my funds in that case or will there be an issue?\n",
      " - Could you please clarify what you meant by 'just set'? Did you just add the external account data in your Online Banking?\n",
      " - Yes..between banks.\n",
      " - Online so I'm able to easily pull the funds if needed to go get a cashiers check.\n",
      " - Could you please clarify; does the external account has the status 'Pending' on it?\n",
      " - No. It was setup with no issues so I can transfer funds between banks.\n",
      " - In case if it was set up correctly; the external transfers are being processed as ACH transfers; and usually take 1-2 business days to come into your external account.\n",
      " - So guessing and of inference from your previous info. the fastest ways can either be through state entity systems or bank wire?\n",
      " - The fastest option would be Zelle (immediate transfer; no delays); however it has a $1000 limitation per day for transfers; no fees.  Second after that; you are right; it would be Wire transfers. They take 1 day to be processed; and there is a $25 fee for them.\n",
      " - In case of Zelle; you need to be enrolled in Zelle both in your external bank; and in <PERSON>.\n",
      " - Oh; okay. I forgot about Zelle.\n",
      " - How can I enroll in Zelle from GLCU? Where do I go online?\n",
      " - I'm about to do it now.\n",

      " - Agent\n",
      " - I am trying to apply for GLCU fast loan\n",
      " - Please use the link below to read more about the Fast Cash loan: https://www.glcu.org/fast-cash-loan/.\n",
      " - There is a general limitation of $2000; but you can apply for different amounts (between $500-$2000) with different terms. For more information and any unexpected cases - please contact our Loan Center representatives at (844) 235-5626.\n",
      " - What does it mean if an account shows a dividend rate and an APR? Do both get applied?\n",
      " - The dividend rate is the rate of return on your investment; while the APR is the rate for loan payments.\n",
      " - Dividend rate applies to Savings; Checking; Money Market; Certificate of Deposit accounts.\n",
      " - So explain dividend .05% and APY .05% on an account please\n",
      " - APY is different from APR and it stands for Annual Percentage Yield.\n",
      " - The key difference between APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and dividend rate lies in how they calculate returns.\n",
      " - APY is the effective annual rate of return; factoring in the effects of compounding interest over a year; while dividend rate is the declared annual return without considering compounding.\n",
      " - For example:  A 5% APY on $1000 will earn you $50 in interest over a year. This is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($1000) by the APY (0.05). The total balance after one year would be $1050.\n",
      " - Ok got that…so where does the dividend rate come in to play? Maybe I’m not asking the question correctly?\n",
      " - If the account shows.05% dividend and .05% apy. APY gets paid yearly when does the dividend get paid?\n",
      " - The dividends are added monthly.\n",
      " - Ok…so each month should see a dividend payment then at the end of the year there should be a one time “yearly” payment?\n",
      " - Ok..this what was confusing me because I have a share savings account and all I see is the monthly dividend. I looked at the history and if what you’re saying is correct; shouldn’t I see an APY payment for the year?\n",
      " - When you select your Savings account in your <LOCATION> tap; tap on the Details tab at the top to check the earnings.\n",
      " - I’m going to come in because when I get details it shows .05% APY neither doesn’t show the .05% dividend rate. And like I said; when I go back and look at the history of transactions; all I see is the monthly dividend. Nowhere is there a transaction that reflects the APY.\n",
      " - You can check all of our share accounts rates on our Deposit Rates page at https://www.glcu.org/rates/deposit-rates/\n",
      " - You can also check our Certificate of Deposit accounts; also the Checking account rates; where you can see how you can earn the most using your checking account.\n",
      " - I would like to receive information on my routing number\n",
      " - Is this my personal routing number?\n",
      " - No; but it can be used to provide for the direct deposit with your account number.\n",
      " - There is no personal routing number for each member at GLCU.\n",
      " - We only see Savings and Checking accounts in your Online Banking.\n",
      " - Have you received a confirmation that your mortgage has transitioned to us?\n",
      " - When should it show my mortgage\n",
      " - Until the Mortgage account is available in your Online Banking; you can send the payments to the following address:  Great Lakes Credit Union; by DMI PO Box 0054 Palatine; IL <US_SSN>.\n",
      " - When will it be available\n",
      " - In case if there are missing payments; or fees charged; it can be quickly resolved by our Mortgages team by calling our Mortgage department at 855-745-4344.\n",
      " - For estimate of when the mortgage account will be available; we will need to submit a request to our specialists to confim.\n",

      " - Are you trying to add a GCLU card to your Apple Pay?\n",
      " - 0007 is the cards last four digits\n",
      " - I have reviewed your account and located the issue. Your checking account was closed and the negative balance was moved to your savings account. This happened due to negative balance not being paid in 30 days.\n",
      " - Ok so can u open it back up?\n",
      " - They never said they would close my account\n",
      " - For this reason your card linked to your checking account is inactive at this time.\n",
      " - They just said I would have to pay another fee of 30 dollars per day\n",
      " - To re-open the Checking account please first cover the negative balance in your Savings account and then you can use 'Add a new share' menu item or call us at (800) 982-7850 or (847)-578-7000 during working hours to open the account.\n",

      " - we have 3 accounts ; checking; savings; and money market.  We need to reconfigure our accounts ; eliminate those we do not need and consider opening a cd account.  Need suggestions.  Obviously need to keep checking account. Do we really need low interest paying money market and savings accounts.  Also; what is the minimum we need to keep in checking account to receive free checking??\n",
      " - Thank you for your patience. The Savings account is necessary to have the membership with GLCU. It has an obligatory minimum balance of $1. This account; therefore; cannot be closed. If you have the Free Checking account; it is free by definition. Free Checking accounts offer a tier system.\n",
      " - As for the Money Market account; it functions in a similar fashion to a Savings account. You can read more about it here: https://www.glcu.org/money-market-account/\n",
      " - You are also welcome to review the deposit rates we offer by using this link:  https://www.glcu.org/rates/deposit-rates/\n",
      " - We currently also offer a promotional 6-month CD with an APY of 3.50%.\n",
      " - So; i could possibly close the money market; keep $1 in savings and open a 6 month CD?   Is there a minimum amount required in the checking account$\n",
      " - This is an option if you find this appropriate. No; there is no minimum deposit for the checking account.\n",
      " - If for some reason (has never happened); a check is written for insufficient funds; what happens.\n",
      " - This would typically result in the check being returned unpaid. A $30 NSF fee may be incurred.\n",
      " - Do you have any option where funds would be automatically transferred to the checking account from savings or money market account.?\n",
      " - The Overdraft Protection Program transfers money from your other GLCU accounts to cover overdrafts. You must have sufficient funds in the other account(s) to cover the transfer. This is a must for those who want to back-up their purchases or withdrawals and are looking for worry-free checking. Please check this page for additional info: https://www.glcu.org/bank/checking/overdraft-protection-services/. So long as you've opted in with a different account to cover; there are no other requirements. This is now free of charge; no fee will be applied if the system transfers funds for you to cover a transaction.  You can set up or modify Overdraft Protection by calling us at (800) 982-7850 or visiting a branch.\n",
      " - Can a cd be used for overdraft protection??\n",
      " - Negative. Withdrawals from the CD prior to maturity are allowed; but come with an individually calculated fee; and CDs cannot be used in Overdraft Protection.\n",
      " - Venmo sent bibrant a 1000 deposit will it still come over to you\n",
      " - I have no clue what account they would have put it in\n",
      " - It depends on what account info has been used - you might want to provide more information; and we can do a follow-up request; or you may call Vibrant / GLCU directly.\n",
      " - Vibrant recieved the deposit and said they are going to forward to you but they did not know what account\n",

      " - Could you please clarify; if you have provided <PERSON> with the account number?\n",

      " - No it should be a mobile deposit that I did last Thursday night. I got a portion of it on Thursday night; but it said that it was the rest of it would be released today.\n",
      " - This will require additional clarification from our Member Service Center specialists.\n",
      " - In this case; the issue is: Mobile Deposit.\n",
      " - do you have cd's and how to acces on your website\n",
